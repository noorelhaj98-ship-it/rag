Overview
As RealSoft initiated a cutting-edge statistical achievement for census and surveys,
carrying a whole process of paperwork to a new level of automation where the use
of paperwork was reduced to zero. A hugely recognizable accomplishment was
reached through developing and implementing fully integrated solution systems
that deployed a vast number of data collectors, team leaders, call center agents,
regional supervisors, and managers to implement mixed mode – tablet door-to-door
and internet- to collect the census data.
Internet-based census approach was adopted for a portion of the population to
accommodate households that would instead fill in their census information online
without the need to be interviewed by enumerators. The solution utilizes various
modern technologies to collect, process, disseminate, and analyze data on different
population characteristics, including economic, social, and demographic aspects.
The technologies deployed vary between tracking and positioning technologies
such as Mobile, GPS (Global Positing System), GIS (Geographic Information"

Our Experience
In the Jordan census 2015, RealSoft drew a remarkable result by developing a
large-scale and high-profile solution, with all census activities fully automated using
Windows 10© tablet devices, to facilitate and assess the data collection process
and ensure its accuracy and validity. At the same, RealSoft was chosen by the
Government of Ajman to develop and implement their census system. This project
was carried out professionally and marked another success of the year.
Several other successful experiences preceded Jordan’s successful experience in
some Arab countries. Back in time to 2007, RealSoft partnered with the Libyan
government to develop the system of the Libya Census of 2007, followed by
Qatar’s and Oman’s Censuses in 2010. RealSoft continued to be the trusted choice

As a continuation of RealSoft’s success stories in implementing different statistical
projects, we recently directed our expertise to select the best standards to improve
statistical data and metadata exchange mechanisms and processes.
Worldwide, two technical standards for statistical and research data and metadata
have recently received much attention; The Statistical Data and Metadata
Exchange (SDMX) and Data Documentation Initiative (DDI). The adoption of such
standards was relatively slow but has now begun to accelerate according to the
benefits achieved by implementing such standards in the statistical process in
general.

- Professional Services
RealSoft has built several big data ecosystems in different domains, e.g.,
enterprise, sectorial, national, regional, and international for numerous
organizations in the MENA region. A modern information supply chain refines data
in zones while providing different types of users access to optimal points in the
supply chain.
- Landing Area
Here, data is ingested, time-stamped, tagged with metadata, and perhaps
encrypted. It is also often ingested in increments via change data capture and
snapshots via periodic refreshes to support time series and other analyses. Very
few business users, if any, access the data in this zone since it’s still in its raw
state, reflecting source system schemas. Only data scientists (~2% of employees)
access this zone. They prefer to use raw, atomic data rather than the scrubbed,
transformed, and aggregated data found in a data warehouse.

- Business Views
A business view represents data in the hub or elsewhere that data explorers (~30%

outside of it, in a relational database or the cloud. There is no single best way to
design a data environment. That’s because data processing technologies are
evolving fast. Relational, Hadoop, NoSQL, and cloud platforms continue to add
features and functions, perpetually shifting which workloads each platform is best
suited to support; however, both the data warehouse and data lake can form the

services and data is vital to provide modern government services to beneficiaries –
citizens, residents, tourists, and businesses, so that they can obtain the single
